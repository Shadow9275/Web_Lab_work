            <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
            <p>The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times, when the location was called Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that the word "spa" originated from the name of the Belgian town named Spa where a curative natural spring was discovered in the 14th century.</p>
            <h3 id="treatments">Treatments</h3> 
            <p>A 'body treatment', spa treatment, or 'cosmetic treatment is non-medical procedure to help the health of the body. It is often performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or school.</p>
            <h3 id="trends">Recent trends</h3>
